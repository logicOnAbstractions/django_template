about
-----------

a definitive Django Project template that has all I would typically need for most applications

components
-------------

* a login system with bases for users
* a superuser fv fv
* data pipeline examples:
    * proper forms setup to enter a new object in a collection
    * Listview & DetailView
* bootstrap installed
* a basic responsive design layout for an index page
* sqlite3 db backend
* use a base.html, with other html using it as a extension



tricks & accelerators
-------------------------

emmet
~~~~~~~~~~

* div.row>div.col.col-md-6*2: will build all the html for a div row, with 2 div col of size 6 within. Super usefule

class, methods & other stubs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* typing "class..." will bring up usual text completion, but also class_django_views, class_django_model, etc.
* each template is adapted to what a class in that context may need (e.g. views use class attribute, typically not __init__() etc.)
